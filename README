README


Basic Information:

    Contained in this repository is code to solve all the problems in the C++ Intro Labs document. All problems, including the kattis-based problems, were solved successfully. Additionally, a makefile is included to automate the process of producing binary executables to solve each problem.

Running Instructions:

    To run the code, first compile and link it using the makefile. The command "make" creates executables for all the solutions, "make compile" compiles but does not link all the code, and "make <problem_name>" createsan execuatble for just the solution code to that problem. The code can then be run using "./<problem_name>" and entering input adhering to the specification in the document or on Kattis.
